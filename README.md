## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure your CSV file is in the same directory as the dashboard script.

## Usage

### Option 1: Use the Launcher Script (Recommended)
```bash
python3 launch_dashboard.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Launch
Try these commands in order until one works:
```bash
python3 -m streamlit run npi_dashboard.py
```
or
```bash
python -m streamlit run npi_dashboard.py
```
or
```bash
streamlit run npi_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will automatically open in your browser (typically `http://localhost:8501`)

## Data Structure

The dashboard works with CSV files containing the following columns:
- `npi`: National Provider Identifier
- `medical group`: Medical group/organization name
- `address`: Street address
- `address 2`: Additional address information (optional)
- `city`: City name
- `state`: State abbreviation
- `zip`: ZIP code
- `tab_source`: Data source tab identifier (automatically added)

## Key Functions

### Search Functionality
- Search across multiple fields simultaneously
- Case-insensitive search
- Supports partial matches

### State-Based Analysis
- View all NPIs for any specific state
- Compare NPI distribution across states
- Export state-specific data

### Data Export
- Download filtered results as CSV
- Download state-specific data
- Maintain original data formatting

## Performance Features

- **Data Caching**: Uses Streamlit's caching to improve performance
- **Efficient Filtering**: Optimized pandas operations for large datasets
- **Responsive Design**: Wide layout for better data visualization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File Not Found Error**: Ensure the CSV file name matches exactly: `ELLKAY NPI List 2025.7.xlsx - Direct EHR 1A.csv`

2. **Memory Issues**: For very large datasets, consider:
   - Using a machine with more RAM
   - Filtering data before loading
   - Processing data in chunks

3. **Slow Performance**: 
   - Close other browser tabs
   - Restart the Streamlit server
   - Clear browser cache

## Customization

You can easily customize the dashboard by:
- Modifying the color scheme in the CSS section
- Adding new chart types using Plotly
- Including additional filters or search fields
- Adding new tabs for specific analysis needs

## Dependencies

- `streamlit`: Web application framework
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `plotly`: Interactive plotting library
